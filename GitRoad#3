When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want it remote, duh

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because too many actions can cause too many consequences!!!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks - make clones of repositories on GitHub automatically.
    Clones - clone rep from GitHub or Local rep.
    Branches - are there for alterations of code and collaborative development.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    idk, man... i came here to study 2 days after last time and feel like 
    I'm lost.
